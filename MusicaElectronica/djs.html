				<td class="left">1. Hardwell<div id="tableslika1"></div></td><td class="mid">It definitely changed a lot of things 
				for me!” Holland’s Robbert van de Corput aka Hardwell is talking about being awarded the No.1 spot in last 
				year’s DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll, which in a rare feat of industry dominance, he’s managed to hold onto for a 
				second year running. “There’s no doubt it’s been a roller-coaster ride with many, many standout moments! 
				Although I’d spent 10 years dreaming of becoming the No.1 DJ, nothing really prepared me for what would happen 
				after that. The most notable thing was the attention it brought from a whole new side of the industry, and people 
				from different scenes. But as anyone who’s watched I Am Hardwell will know, my musical journey is something I’ve 
				been working on for many years now. It hasn’t been an overnight success; the documentary itself was three years in 
				the making.”</td><td class="right">
                Tune of the year: “Coldplay ‘Sky Full of Stars’.”
                <br>From: Breda, Holland.
                <br>Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: “Julian Calor, Thomas Newson and Kill the Buzz.”</td></tr>

				<td class="left">2. Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike<div id="tableslika2"></div></td><td class="mid">f the titles weren’t enough, then the sounds of Dimitri 
				Vegas & Like Mike’s tracks ‘Tremor’ and ‘Body Talk (Mammoth)’ with their hippo-sized basslines, shrieking hyena riffs and 
				drum-rolls that stampede like rhinos show that Belgian brothers Dimitri and Michael Thivaois are amongst dance music’s big beasts. 
				And they’ve been roaming far and wide this year, playing across Mexico, Brazil and the UK, launching a new residency in Ibiza, and 
				returning home to the Tomorrowland festival, which they’ve headlined for five years.
				“Tomorrowland is huge for us because we have been residents there since almost the beginning,” they enthuse. “But it means so much more, 
				it’s actually held in the field near to our grandparents' house where we played football as young kids. Obviously it has helped our 
				careers but we’ve worked hard to build up our profile outside of Tomorrowland.”</td><td class="right">Tune of the year: Dimitri Vegas & 
				Like Mike and Martin Garrix ‘Tremor’ (Spinnin' Records).”
				From: Willebroek, Belgium
				Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: Wolfpack</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">3. Armin Van Buuren<div id="tableslika3"></div></td><td class="mid">“I'm blessed you know. I'm totally blessed. You have to imagine
				there's millions of DJs out there and everybody wants to be a DJ,” the Dutch demi-god tells DJ Mag when asked how come he always looks so happy. 
				“So I'm blessed. I'm blessed with this life. I'm blessed to be talking to you. I'm blessed to get so much recognition from so many fans around 
				the world. That's how I feel about it. Blessed. There's no better words.” OK, so many people would like to be a DJ, but not so many people can do 
				it in the way that he does. His Armin Only tour takes 35 people as part of its entourage, including a theatre director, trapeze artists, dancers, 
				singers and musicians, and is the current state of play for the State Of Trance hero. “I just went from A to B to C to D to E. To be honest with you, 
				there was no planning behind all this. Sometimes it was, 'OK let's try this'.”</td><td class="right">Tune of the year: “I think it's a draw between 
				Jorn Van Deynhoven 'New Horizons' and MaRLo 'Visions'.” From: Leiden, Netherlands Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: “David Gravell.”</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">4. Martin Garrix<div id="tableslika4"></div></td><td class="mid">“The last 12 months have been kind of crazy, a lot of fun,” Martin Garrix 
				tells DJ Mag down the phone from Holland. “I'm very happy with how everything went. We released a lot of tracks. After 'Animals' it's gone crazy, for 
				one-and-a-half years now it has been really wild. ”Martin Garrix was a new entry at No.40 in 2013, and has shot up to No.4 in the last 12 months — making 
				him officially one of the biggest DJs in the world. And yet he is still a teenager. Yes, Martin was only born in 1996 — after the release of 'Born Slippy' 
				by Underworld, the 'Timeless' album by Goldie, and well after when his mentor Tiësto first started releasing material. Indeed, it was watching Tiësto's DJ 
				performance at the 2004 Olympics, at the age of eight, when he first expressed interest in becoming a DJ. </td><td class="right">Best known for: “Animals.”
                From: Amstelveen, Holland
                Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: Oliver Heldens.</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">5. Tiesto<div id="tableslika5"></div></td><td class="mid">Tijs ‘Tiësto’ Verwest has had a busy year. Not only has the Dutch DJ/producer released his 
				‘A Town Called Paradise’ album, he’s also been executing gig after gig, travelling the world while fulfilling his residency at glitzy Las Vegas superclub
				Hakkasan — alongside Calvin Harris. These days, Tiësto’s sets are filled with tunes that fall into the poppier, housier side of EDM — a far cry from the hard, 
				fast, hardcore trance sound that made his name. The 45-year-old former Top 100 DJs poll winner started out his career DJing at a small club called The Spock, 
				playing hardcore and gabba, while producing similar sounds under a string of monikers including Stray Dog, Tom Ace and TB X-Press. </td><td class="right">Style: EDM
                From: Breda, Holland.</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">6. Avicii<div id="tableslika6"></div></td><td class="mid">The man whose ubiquitous hit 'Levels', perhaps more than any other, drew focus to the scale 
				of the EDM industry emerging in the US in 2011, Avicii is the same guy who dared to combine country music with electronica on 'Wake Me Up' and 'Hey Brother' last year 
				to wild worldwide acclaim. He's reigned supreme as the fresh-faced poster boy of a mass-marketed multi-billion dollar scene for the best part of three years. But his 
				admittance in 2013 that he'd cut back on alcohol after being diagnosed with acute pancreatitis while on tour brought to light the pressures placed on an individual in
				his situation to a brand-new audience. </td><td class="right">Style: Progressive, electro house, country/EDM, pop. From: Sweden.</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">7. David Guetta<div id="tableslika7"></div></td><td class="mid">2014 has been dominated by two things for David Guetta: the first he doesn’t like to talk 
				about and involves him splitting from his wife and manager of many years, and the second, his follow-up album to 2011’s 'Nothing But the Beat', he has talked about a lot. 
                Over the past year and more the French dance pin-up has been promising something completely different, and reports have even claimed its release has been much delayed owing 
				to his insecurity about the brave new project. </td><td class="right">Tune of the year: ‘Dangerous’, I hope. My new single, which 
				is soon to be released. A totally new sound. Are you ready for it?”From: Paris, France.</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">8. Skrillex<div id="tableslika8"></div></td><td class="mid">Skrillex’s ‘Recess’ almost seemed to arrive just as out the blue — sure, as a ubiquitous presence 
				at awards ceremonies, festivals and gossip websites Sonny John Moore is as far from being an Aphex-like hermit figure as Steve Aoki is from being ‘any good’ — but after four 
				years of EPs and singles like 2011’s breakthrough ‘Bangarang’ and last year’s ‘Try It Out’ few were expecting the former emo rocker turned EDM superstar to produce something 
				as archaic as an actual album, especially since his trademark sound is so hyperactive it can be too much to take after 45 seconds, let alone 45 minutes. 
				</td><td class="right">Style: Bass, electro and beyond.
                From: LA, US.</td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">9. Nicky Romero<div id="tableslika9"></div></td><td class="mid">Despite his Spanish-sounding name, the Aryan-looking, blued-eyed, progressive house DJ/producer 
				Nicky Romero is yet another member of the Dutch dance music mafia. “Fedde Le Grand is my buddy and guide and has had a great influence on my career,” says Nicky, whose real name 
				is Nick Rotteveel van Gotum. Fellow Dutchman Fedde is “someone I looked up to all my life and still do”, says Nicky. “I consider him a great friend and also mentor.”
				</td><td class="right">Tune of the year:  “The 'Next Level' track we released by John Christian was really big for me this year and a real floorfiller.”
                From: Holland.
                Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: “I am really into Disclosure, Flume and Netsky. </td></tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="left">10. Steve Aoki<div id="tableslika10"></div></td><td class="mid">It's no exaggeration to say that Steve Aoki is a daredevil DJ. We grab a chat with him in-between his airplane 
				stunt flying session and heading off on his private jet to play the closing party of his Pacha night in Ibiza. “It's so weird, it's just like you're going to die all the time and 
				you feel like you're going to throw up all the time too, you go upside down, you've got the g-force it's so powerful, it makes you sick all the time,” he tells us about the former. 
				</td><td class="right">Tune of the year:  “'Delirious (Boneless)'.”
                From: Newport Beach, USA.
                Breakthrough DJ/producer of 2014: “Botnek.”</td></tr>
