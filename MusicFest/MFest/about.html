				<p>Jungle is an award-winning summer music festival. It is held annualy 
				in the city of Sarajevo, which is considered by many as one of the best
				festival venues in the world. Jungle was officially proclaimed as the
				'Best Major European Festival' at the EU Festival Awards 2014.</p>
				
				<p>For over a decade now Jungle Festival has been offering consistently 
				successful musical events. This Sarajevo music promoter has, 
				since its modest beginnings, developed a strong commitment to music 
				so that spectators of different generations can enjoy live music to the full. 
				This is clearly reflected in the quality and innovation of its line-ups 
				that exude coherence, eclecticism and the love of risk-taking.</p>
				
				<p>Jungle Festival has been taking place in Sarajevo since 2001, 
				has consolidated itself as a model reference for urban festivals and is 
				internationally considered an unmissable event. It stands out from the rest 
				of macro musical events and is characterised by an artistic line marked by pop, 
				rock and the most underground tendencies of dance music.</p>
