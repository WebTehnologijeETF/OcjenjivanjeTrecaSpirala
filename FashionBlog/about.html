	<p>Hello. My name is Emina Muharemovic. On EmFashion I love to cover the latest in trends, street style, and editorials, as well as share style inspiration, ways to get the looks and my latest shopping picks. Starting at the tender age of 16, the blog was primarily a place to express my interest toward vintage fashions and thrifted finds, but has now expanded into outfits of the day and occasional beauty and lifestyle posts. EmFashion is growing everyday, with press mentions from topshop, MTV, stylist.co.uk, Elle Spain, More Magazine, GLOSS magazine, London Fashion Week Official, Cosmopolitan.co.uk, online.</p>
